# Overview

This is a HTML and JavaScript based memory game that uses simple emoticons as the cards to match. I wanted to create a game in JavaScript because I hope to pursue a job in the Game Design industry and wanted to see what JavaScript had toteach me regard certain coding styles and commands that might come in handy when I pursue a career.

The purpose of this project was to create a memory game for myself and see what can be done when javaScript animation and HTML go hand in hand.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
